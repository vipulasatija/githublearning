Enhance your Git skillset, and explore intermediate techniques and concepts that can help you work more efficiently with the popular open-source version control software. Instructor Kevin Skoglund shares branch management techniques, like deleting and pruning, and how to use tags to mark important points in the branch history. Learn to use interactive staging to stage small portions of a file, cherry-picking to share commits between branches, patches to share commits with others, and techniques for tracking down problems in your project. Kevin demystifies the rebase command and explains when to choose rebasing over merging.

## Instructions
- You can follow along using the GutHub repository.
- You can also download the whole repository by cloning it. 
- You don't need to have a GitHub account to follow along. You can click the code button on the main repo page and then choose the download option for downloading a zip file that contains the repository. 

The repository includes directories for each chapter and video in the course. You can navigate to the directory that corresponds to the video that you're watching. The files for the start of the course are in chapter 01 and the first file is 0101.zip. Each zip file contains a separate git repository containing the files and commits as they exist at the start of the video. Each repository has been compressed so they can exist inside the main GitHub repository. You can also just download a single set of exercise files by clicking on the name and then on the download button.
